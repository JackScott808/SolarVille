🌞 SolarVille: Table-top Smart Grid Demo 🌩️
📄 Summary
Welcome to SolarVille! The future of our grid  – packed into a sleek table-top demo using Raspberry Pis, rechargeable batteries, and mini solar panels. Dive into the world of energy management, where consumption meets innovation. 🚀

🤖 Overview
SolarVille isn't just any demo; it's a power-packed simulation designed to mimic real-life scenarios of a smart grid. Armed with Raspberry Pis acting as consumers and prosumers, we delve into the dynamic world of electricity that's not just used but also generated and shared. Here’s the cool part:

You control 🕹️ real-time generation with mini solar panels.
You monitor the juice 📊 (state of charge) in our lithium-ion batteries.
You rule the grid, directing power where it's needed or trading it with your neighbours!

⛈️ Plus, Weather Modes! 🌞
Experience how weather messes with energy. Normal day? Heat wave? Stormy skies? Each scenario uniquely affects power generation and demand. Buckle up, as SolarVille brings you the climate challenge!
